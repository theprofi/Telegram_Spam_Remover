# Telegram_Spam_Remover
Using a bot to remove spam according to groups subject using AI and a web UI for management 

This is the final project that I did with a friend for Computer Science Bsc.
This project uses AI to detect and remove unrelated messages in a telegram group according to the subject that the telegram bot learns.

Admins can mark for the bot each messages for his group as "good" or "bad" after about 1000 such messages the bot learns the subject of the group and can help the admin to keep
the discussion relevent. 

Along with the bot there is also web UI that I built using CherryPu library and using it admins can see all the marked messaged and edit them.

You can watch the demo and read the technical report for more details.
